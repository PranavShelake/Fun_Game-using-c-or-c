# Tic Tac Toe

**Description:**  
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game implemented in C++. Players alternate turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid with their symbols (X or O), aiming to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. The game checks for win conditions, displays the result, and determines if the game ends in a draw.

**Technologies Used:**  
- **C++:** For implementing the game logic, including turn management, win condition checks, and game result determination.

**Features:**  
- **Two-Player Mode:** Enables two players to take turns and compete against each other.
- **Win and Draw Detection:** Determines and announces the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Simple Console Interface:** Provides a straightforward interface to display the game board and results.

**Challenges Overcome:**  
- **Implementing Win Conditions:** Developing robust logic to check for win conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **User Interaction:** Ensuring clear and responsive interaction through the console interface.

**Outcome:**  
The Tic Tac Toe game demonstrates fundamental C++ programming skills and game logic implementation. It provides an engaging way to practice and showcase basic programming concepts and logic development.
